# Exploring Weather Trends
## by Aliscia Boyd


## Dataset: Global city data provided by Udacity

> In this project I examine a dataset consisting of three CSV files, each containing data related to the weather trends in cities across the globe.


## Summary of Findings

The observations and findings presented in this project indicate a rise in average global temperatures over the last 250 years. This global increase is causing individual cities around the globe to experienced increased averages as well. Overall, these findings indicate that the Earth as a whole is getting warmer.


## Key Insights

> The temperatures in my local city are consistently higher on average when compared to the global temperatures over the 250 year period in question.

> Both local and global average temperatures generally rose and fell around the same times, with the exception of one very noticeable period from 1776 to 1780.

> Overall, both local and global average temps have been trending slightly upward over the period in question.

> Neither geographical location nor local climate type change the general upward trend in temperature.
